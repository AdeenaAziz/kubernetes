This is a comprehensive DevOps project about creating a shell script to track AWS resource usage. Let me summarize the key points:

Project Overview
A shell script to monitor AWS resource usage for cost optimization in cloud infrastructure.

Why This Project is Important
1. Cost Management: Organizations move to cloud for cost-effectiveness (pay-as-you-go)
2. Resource Tracking: Prevent unused resources (EC2 instances, EBS volumes) from incurring costs
3. Reporting: Daily reports to management about resource utilization

Resources to Track
1. AWS S3 buckets
2. AWS EC2 instances
3. AWS Lambda functions
4. AWS IAM users
