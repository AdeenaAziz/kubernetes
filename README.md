This is a comprehensive DevOps project about creating a shell script to track AWS resource usage. Let me summarize the key points:

_Project Overview:_
A shell script to monitor AWS resource usage for cost optimization in cloud infrastructure.

_Why This Project is Important_
1. Cost Management: Organizations move to cloud for cost-effectiveness (pay-as-you-go)

3. Reporting: Daily reports to management about resource utilization
